    <h3> Our Story</h3>
    <h4>From Food truck to restaurant</h4>
  <p> Taco Tontos' long history started in 1972 with a man named Mike Miller, aka “Tonto" who ran a small food cart outside a local bar in Kent, Ohio. In the early 80's Maureen Gartland moved Taco Tontos from food cart to closet-sized kitchen located in the basement of The Loft in downtown Kent.  Though the menu was small, the food was prepared fresh each day, and cooked individually for each customer. People enjoyed and appreciated the quality, tailor-made food and thus began the long tradition of very loyal customers. The expanding business moved in 2002 to it’s current location on Franklin Ave. in downtown Kent. We were honored and elated to have the opportunity to become the owners of Taco Tontos in 2012.</p>
  <p> We still prep our food daily. We still cook each order individually for each customer. Some of our business is from our long-time fans, and some from the casual customer, simply looking for a bite to eat. But what makes Taco Tontos unique is the feedback we get from our customers. We see a huge number of visitors weekly, and yet almost daily someone will take a minute to tell us how much our burritos mean to them! We cannot tell you how many times people have come back into town and told us that Taco Tontos was the first stop they made. It's also not uncommon for a fan returning to Chicago or New York or wherever they’ve moved to order a cooler of burritos to take back with them. Thanks to our awesome customers we can and will continue to do what we love, making people happy with our delicious food.</p>
